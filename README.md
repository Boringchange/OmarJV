# Hi everyone, I'm Omar Vazquez :3.

I'm a guy who believes in miracles üòá, also, I love to resolve hard problems and exploring new solutions ü§ì. I like to research new things that help me think deferently. I'm in love with games and I'm looking to make video games in a professional way. My dream is to build a new way to connect AI and video games ‚ù§Ô∏èüëæ.
